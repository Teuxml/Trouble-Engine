Any dialogue the game uses will go under the song folder with the JSONs as "dialogue.txt"
Using it is simple. In stages that are NOT the school stages, you just type text and use line breaks to separate each message for the dialogue.
For the stages that ARE the school, you have to use ":dad:" or ":bf:" (depending on who you want to talk) before each sentence/message.
Soon, dialogue will switch to JSONs, just to keep things simple.
